## Openshift on your Windows 10 pro machine

Make sure your machine is multi core and has at last 16gb of ram.
Windows 10 PRO is a requirement.

### Prepare your machine
Prepare your laptop/desktop for Openshift.   

* Connect to an Ethernet connection and disable your wireless network card   
see ***Disable wireless network adapter*** below

* Turn on Hypervisor
	* control panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows features on or off   
	* Enable all Hyper-v options.

* Add your id to the HyperVisor Admnistrators Group via PowerShell
     * run powershell as admninistrator

     * Via Powershell add yourself to the Hyperv administrators group:   
     ```powershell
     ([adsi]"WinNT://./Hyper-V Administrators,group").Add("WinNT://$env:UserDomain/$env:Username,user")
     ```

c.testing
```   

### Go to the Openshift console
[https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing](https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing)
   
### Use the Openshift OC command line interface
* In a cmd prompt set your environment   
```powershell

```
@FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('crc oc-env') DO @call %i

# See below if you get any errors

### Disable wireless network adapter
I have had issues where the Hyper-v virtual switch doesnt work if it uses the wirless adapter for the virtual ethernet card.   
I have had to disable the wireless adapter so that Hyper-v chooses the Ethernet adapter for Default Switch.      
* Go to Control Panel --> Network and Internet --> Network Connections

* Open the Hyper-v manager and verify that the Default switch is using the Ethernet adapter

### Fix windows 10 Pro bug if you get an error on crc start   
This is related to a bug with how Hyper-v on windows handles DHCP for virtual machines.   
```bash
ERRO Error occurred: Error approving the node csr Not able to get csr names (exit status 1 : Unable to connect to the se
rver: dial tcp 172.18.7.77:6443: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly res
pond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
```  
   
* Open a Powershell cmd prompt with admin priviliges

* Get the IP address of your Openshift Hyper-v VM   
```get-vm -Name crc | Select -ExpandProperty Networkadapters```

* Open Notepad with admin priviliges

* Open the hosts file in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc with ip address entries for your Openshift VM
```bash
# replace you VM ip address with the address below and save the file
172.18.7.77  api.crc.testing
