***if you use instructions below, you do so at your own risk***

- assuming you have Amazon Prime.

2. you get an easy to do upgrade as Acer makes this particular laptop easy to upgrade.

3. The slow 1TB drive that comes with you lapto is reused as a storage and archive area.

4. you get bootup in less than 10 seconds.

6. You're installing from the Windows 10 Disk without any 
bloatware.
