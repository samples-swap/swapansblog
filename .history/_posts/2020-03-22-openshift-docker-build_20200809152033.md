## Base image creation

====================
**Create a build config for  binary docker build**
Creates build config objects. This sets up a docker build in openshift that pushes to artifactory using the openjdk image as a base.
instructions on sourcing the oc binary [oc-binary-source.md](oc-binary-source.md)

```bash
oc new-build --name=base-mule-image-build --binary=true --to=openshiftdockerregistry.local.com/base-mule-image:latest --to-docker=true --strategy=docker --image-stream=bac/openjdk18:latest
```

## clone the base build repo**

```bash
git clone ssh://****.git
```

## cd to the cloned project folder and do a docker build and push base image to repo

```bash
cd $proj_folder
oc start-build base-mule-image-build --from-dir=.
```

## App base image layered on binary base image

====================
This sets up a docker build in openshift, which uses the previously created mule base image as the base layer.  
It pushes the final image to artifactory
**create App image build config**

```bash
oc new-build --name=app-mule-image-build --binary=true --to=openshiftdockerregistry.local.com/app-mule-image:latest --to-docker=true --strategy=docker --docker-image=openshiftdockerregistry.local.com/base-mule-image:latest
```

## Starts the build for the app image.  Run this in the directory with the application docker file and the application jar**

```bash
oc sta
